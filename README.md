Welcome to The Proteome Browser (TPB). This web portal brings together data and information about human proteins from a number of sources and presents them in a gene- and chromosome-centric, interactive format. This resource is currently in the initial phase of development; hence this is only a draft version to demonstrate its potential.

TPB is an initiative of the Australia/New Zealand Chromosome 7 consortium of the Chromosome-centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP).

TPB is currently being developed by the Monash University e-Research Centre (MeRC)with funding for the initial phase of development provided by the Australian National Data Service (ANDS).

An important concept of this resource is that it is developed in close collaboration with the global proteomics community. We therefore encourage your involvement and input. For more information, to keep up to date with developments or to provide suggestions/feedback please check the Project Wiki or join the Discussion Group.

A detailed specification is available at Technical Design and Specification.
